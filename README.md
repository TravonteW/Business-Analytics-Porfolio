# Business-Analytics-Porfolio
This is a working portfolio to advance my career in business analytics. I will be practicing using different statistical tools such as R, Tableau, and Python. I will also be uploading the datasets that I use along side the projects I created.  To keep a log of my projects and progress I will be writing in the README file.
